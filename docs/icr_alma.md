# nf-core/configs: Institute of Cancer Research (Alma HPC) Configuration

Deployment and testing of nf-core pipelines on the Alma cluster is on-going in collaboration between the RSE team and research groups.

To run an nf-core pipeline on Alma, run the pipeline with `-profile icr_alma`. This will download and launch the [`icr_alma.config`](../conf/icr_alma.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the Alma HPC cluster. 

Before running the pipeline you will need to load Nextflow using the environment module system. The preferred way is to create a condo or mamba environment (you only need to do this once) which you activate.

```bash
## Create and activate mamba environment
mamba create --name mamba_nf -c bioconda nextflow nf-core
mamba activate mamba_nf
```

Singularity is installed on the compute nodes of Alma, but not the login nodes. There is no module for Singularity.

All of the intermediate files required to run the pipeline will be stored in the `work/` directory. It is recommended to delete this directory after the pipeline has finished successfully because it can get quite large.

> NB: Nextflow will need to submit the jobs via SLURM to the HPC cluster. This can be done from an interactive or normal job. If in doubt contact Scientific Computing.

Alma has a master-worker partition for the long running nextflow manager which spwans jobs to the compute node. A typical nextflow job will run a batch script thorugh sbatch which will run on the master-worker thread spawning the jobs.

Command to run the nextflow job:
```bash
sbatch my-nextflow.sh
```

Contents of my-nextflow.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
TO DO ADD A GOOD BATCH or mae it a 1-line from interactive without the sh
```
